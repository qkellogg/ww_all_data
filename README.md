In this project we maintain the full dataset generated and maintained by Watershed Watch (WW).

WW provide current (and historical) information on the water quality of surface water resources 
throughout Rhode Island, including lakes, ponds, reservoirs, rivers, streams and the marine environment.  
Trained volunteer monitors take weekly measurements from spring to fall.
